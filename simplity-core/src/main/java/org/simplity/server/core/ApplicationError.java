 * Base unchecked exception that represents an exception caused because of some

 * inconsistent data in the DB, incompatible arguments etc..
 *
 * The framework throws this whenever it detects exceptions that are not
 * supposed to happen by design. It must be caught at the highest level, say
 * service agent.

 * Motivation for this design is to provide a mechanism for the app to centrally
 * handle all such exceptions and plumb it to the org-wide infrastructure.
