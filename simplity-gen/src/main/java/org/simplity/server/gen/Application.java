/**
 * Design Considerations:
 * Problem on hand:
 * Generate desired Java classes and TypeScript files for the meta data specified for this app.
 *
 * Approach:
 * Meta data is in Json files. We can either read them as Json Objects, or create data structures/classes.
 * We decided to use classes with matching data-structures for ease of reading/loading.
 *
 * Source code generation is lengthy, but not complex. This is probably reflected in our design as well.
 * Lengthy methods with heavily hard-coded strings.
 *
 * Since this is a fairly focused, non-generic code, we have used package-private attributes and avoided setters/getters
